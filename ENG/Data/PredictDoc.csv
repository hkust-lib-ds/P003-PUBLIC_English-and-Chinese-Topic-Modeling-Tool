U.S. imperialism and social-imperialism are beset with difficulties both at home and abroad and find them isolated as never before. The development of revolutionary situation in the world has testified to what Chairman Mao has pointed out: 'The danger of a new world war still exists, and the people of all countries must get prepared. But revolution is the main trend in the world today.'
The revolution is developing, the people are marching forward. No matter how U.S. imperialism and its collaborator rack their brains and report to every conceivable tactic, they can in no way save themselves from their inevitable doom.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The film has been warmly received by the workers, peasants and soldiers.
In the course of making the film, the comrades at the Peking Film Studio and the art workers of the Peking Opera Troupe of Shanghai put proletarian politics in command and, with Mao Tsetung Thought as their weapon, carried out revolutionary mass criticism in a deep-going way to eradicate the remnant pernicious influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the renegade, hidden traitor and scab Liu Shao-chi and his agents Chou Yand, Hsia Yen, Tien Han and Tang Han-sheng in the sphere of literature and art. All this helped the revolutionary film and art workers raise their consciousness in putting into practice Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art and promote their ideological revolutionization. Through repeated trials, they finally turned out a successful film on 'Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy', a model revolutionary theatrical work scintillating with the brilliance of Mao Tsetung Thought.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the Shanghai working class has built up modern factories one after another along the Whangpoo River in the spirit of self-reliance. Mechanization has been achieved initially on Shanghai docks, where goods were moved by carrying poles and baskets in the past. Today, the Whangpoo River presents a scene of prosperity.",,,,,,,,,,,,
plxh-0428,"Stupendous changea in sooialist revolution and socialist
construction have taken place in east China's city of Soochow in the past twenty-five years. This ancient city now has taken on a completely new look.
Located by Taihu Lake in Kiangsu Province, the city came into existence more than 2,500 years ago (the King Helu of the Wu State in the Spring and Autumn Period made Soochow his capital). Before liberation it was a typical consumer city satisfying the luxury of the reactionary Kuomintang bureaucrats, the bourgeoisie and the landlord class. It has only a few factories, and handicraft shops accounted for 95 per cent of its industry
After liberation the people of Soochow worked hard to transform and reconstruct the city and develop its socialist economy with Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as a guide. Now the city has over 400 factories, including those turning out metals, instruments and electronic products. Most articles of daily use needed by the city's residents are produced locally. New housing eatates are being put up in a planned way and streets are radiating. Many famous gardens and historical sites have been renovated. There is also much progress in cultural, health and educational work. Tempered in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the people of Soochow are advancing along the broad road of socialism with ever greater enthusiasm.",,,,,,,,,,,,
plxh-0493,"The Tachai Production Brigade, China's national pace-setter in agriculture, in Shansi Province, has increased farm mechanization in line with Chairman Mao's teaching 'The fundamental way out for agriculture lies in mechanization.'
Firmly taking the socialist road, the mountainous Tachai brigade has expanded agriculture by self-reliance and hard struggle. As production developed, the Tachai peasants felt a pressing need for mechanization. They bought tractors and has virtually mechanized or semi-mechanized its ploughing, farmland capital construction, transport, threshing, and farm produce processing. Work done by machinery each year equals the number of workdays done by 60 per cent of the able-bodied brigade members in a year.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The commune has 1,800 Tibetan herding folk living on a 490 square kilometre pasture. Oppressed and exploited by the Kuomintang reactionaries and feudal herd-owners in bygone days, they lived in misery. After liberation, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, they were emancipated politically and took up socialist collectivization and their life has been improving with each passing day. The Cultural Revolution and the current movement to criticize Lin Piao and Confucius have further fired the socialist enthusiasm of the herdsmen which has in turn put spurs to livestock breeding. Now the number of animals in the commune is double that of 1965, the year before the Cultural Revolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,
plxh-0504,"The completion of the first-stage undertaking of the gigantic Tankiangkou water-control project for harnessing the Hankiang river in Hupeh Province has given an impetus to agriculture and industry in the river valley. The first-stage scheme embraces a dam, a reservoir, a power station and a ship lift.
A major tributary of the Yangtze, Hankiang ranks among the unruly rivers in China. During the 1935 flood in old China, it submerged 446,000 hectares of farmland and took a toll of 80,000 lives.
The first-stage Tankiangkou project now effectively controls the surging waters of the upper reaches of the Hankiang and basically frees its lower reaches of flood threats. The reservoir nourishes the arid farmland in north Hupeh and the neighbouring southwest Honan. The 900,000-kilowatt hydro-power station has become a major electricity supplier to Hupeh and Honan provinces. The project also facilitates inland shipping and promotes fish breeding.",,,,,,,,,,,,
plxh-0509,"Nanking, a 2,000 year-old ancient city in east China, has grown into a socialist industrial city with a population of 2,400,000. It now turns out ores, iron and steel, telecommnications equipment, machine tools, automobiles, petrochemicals, chemical fibres and other industrial products.
Situated in the lower reaches of the Yangtze, Nanking served as the capital of eight feudal dynasties from the 3rd century down to the early 15th century. Under the Kuomintang reactionary rule, Nanking was its political center for suppressing and exploiting the labouring people, and a consumer city where the bureaucrats indulged in a life of extravagance.
After liberation the labouring people, who have become masters of the city, worked hard to implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and rebuilt Nanking into a prosperous socialist industrial city under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.
Spurred by the current movement to criticize Lin Piao and Confucius, Nanking has made still greater progress in socialist revolution and socialist construction on all fronts.",,,,,,,,,,,,
plxh-0598,"Tungshiang Cunty in east China's Chekiang Province, long known as a land of fish and rice, has today emerged as an advanced unit of the province in learning from Tachai, national pace-setter in agriculture.
Tunghsiang in central part of the fertile Hangchow-Chiahsiang-Huchow Plain on the Yangtze River delta is criss-crossed by rivers and streams. It is a producer of grain, as well as silkworm cocoons, freshwater fish, domestic animals and tobacco. But under the rule of the reactionary Kuomintang government, rivers were neglected and began to silt up. The area used to suffer water-logging and consequently production declined.
Agricultural production recovered and increased after liberation when the peasants embarked on the road of agricultural cooperation under the leadership of the Party. Notable progress has been made in the county in the movement to learn from Tachai since the Cultural Revolution and the movement to criticize Lin Piao and Confucius. Relying on the collective efforts of the people's commune, cadres and masses of the county have built water conservatory projects, popularized good seed strains, practised scientific farming and varied production on a growing scale. This has made the county the Tachai of Chekiang. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
plxh-0600,"Guided by Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, people in Linhsien County, Honan Province, cut the Red Flag Canal in the Taihang Mountains after a decade of stupendous effort. This man-made river has ended the centuries-old scourge of drought and turned the poor hilly district into a prosperous new socialist countryside. The change in Linhsien is a great victory for Mao Tsetung Thought.
Before liberation, Linhsien was an arid area and suffered from an acute shortage of water. People had to trudge miles to fetch drinking water. After liberation, the people of Linhsien began to remake the face of nature. In a decade of hard work starting in 1960, they completed a network of canals and ditches, totalling 1,500 kilometres, bringing in water from the Changho River in neighbouring Shansi Province through the Taihang Mountains. The age-long dream of Linhsien people to lead water to their mountain villages has finally come true under socialism. The county's total irrigated area has been enlarged 50-fold to 40,000 hectares. Grain yield per hectare increased from about 0.75 ton to 4.41 tons.
The completion of the Red Flag Canal ensures an all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, side-line occupation and fishery. Small industries producing iron and steel, electricity, cement and chemical fertilizer have been built.",,,,,,,,,,,,
plxh-0606,"Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the heroic Chinese railway workers and the 
fighters of the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army successfully completed the Chengtu-Kunming Railway -- a trunk-line in southwest China -- during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Since it was opened to traffic on July 1, 1970, the railway has been proved up to the standard required and performed efficient services in transportation.
The 1,085-kilometre-long railway begins at Chengtu, capital of Szechwan Province, and terminates at Kunming, capital of the border province of Yunnan. It connects with the Chengtu-Paochi line and serves as a key link between southwest and northwest China. The completion of the railway opens new possibilities for closer unity of the people of various nationalities and for boosting industry and agriculture in southwest China. It will also help improve the distribution of China's industry.
The Chengtu-Kunming Railway passes through the region which the Chinese Red Army traversed on its famous Lone March. Building the railway is an arduous task because it runs through the turbulent Tatu and Chinsha Rivers and winds around the Greater and Lesser Liangshan Mountains. The builders had to negotiate the complex geological conditions and changeable weather. Some foreign experts
said the job was 'impossible' when they went there to inspect the terrain in 1958. Responding to the great call, 'the Chengtu-Kunming Railway must be built at a fast pace', issued by Chairman Mao in 1964, the railway builders criticized such revisionist trash as the slavish comprador philosophy and 'go-it-slow' policy. By bringing into full play the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, they completed the engineering feat in 1970. The railway has 427 tunnels and 653 bridges, totalling more than 400 kilometres in length.
The railway workers have raised their enthusiasm in the current movement to criticize Lin Piao and Confucius and are working for increased efficiency and better quality of transportation for socialist revolution and construction.",,,,,,,,,,,,
plxh-0607,"Women account for 70% of the entire workers at the Peking No.3 Cotton Mill. They are an important force in grasping revolution and promoting production. Tempered in the Cultural Revolution, they have greatly changed their mental outlook. At the call of 'spin and weave for the revolution', the women workers are actively introducing technical innovations and working hard along with men to improve the quality of textiles. Quite a number of them have been promoted to leading posts and have a say in factory management. Now, they are taking an active part in the movement to criticize Lin Piao and Confucius.
The Peking No.3 Cotton Mill ranks among the three major textile mills built in the nation's capital after liberation. It has outstripped the state plan year after year since its establishment in 1957. The variety of the mill's products has increased from a few to more than 30.",,,,,,,,,,,,
